<h1>SawTeeth Documentation (1.4.1)</h1>
<p>
I'm glad that you're interested in sawteeth (you are
reading the readme you know).
<h2>Credits</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Player code, ideas and design by Jonas Norberg.</li>
	<li>Arvid Norberg developed big parts of the editor.</li>
	<li>Most of the filtercode comes from Stefan H&aring;llen.</li>
	<li>Since the 1.3 version, development done by Adrien Destugues.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you find any error in any program or the
manual please let me know, I even care about
faulty grammar/spelling (I don't speak
native English).</p><p>
I am also interested in cool ideas and really cool
features that you miss in the player or in the editor.</p>

<h1>Making music with Sawteeth</h1>
A Sawteeth song is made up by several pieces.
Instruments are used in parts, which are used in
channels, which are used in the song.
<br>
Hexadecimal and Decimal are used where seen fit,
witch you easily could be tricked by.

<p>
I hope that most menu-items, buttons and textfields
are self-explaining or explained in the GUI.
</p>

<h2>Sequencer</h2>
<p>
Not very intuitive controls I'm afraid.<br>
Click a part to make it 'active'. Double click to open the part editor.
<p>
On the parts (the sqares) you see three numbers, the first is partnumber,
the second is transpose and the last is damping.
<p>

<table>
<tr><td><b>0-9</b></td><td>Enter partnumber (decimal)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>arrows</b></td><td>Navigate</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>ctrl-arrows (up-down)</b></td><td>Transpose</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>ctrl-arrows (left-right)</b></td><td>Change damping</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>shift-arrows</b></td><td>Mark</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>cmd-x</b></td><td>cut</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>cmd-c</b></td><td>copy</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>cmd-v</b></td><td>paste</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>cmd-space</b></td><td>Play song</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>l</b></td><td>Set left loop point</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>r</b></td><td>Set right loop point</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>enter</b></td><td>Open Parteditor</td></tr>

</table>

<h2>Part editor</h2>
This is similar to old-skool trackers in many ways. NoiseTracker (all
trackers) style keyboard.<p>

<table>
<tr><td><b> F1 - F12 </b></td><td> sets octave. </td></tr>
<tr><td><b> Delete </b></td><td> zeroes the field you edit. </td></tr>
<tr><td><b> Shift-Delete </b></td><td> zeres the whole line. </td></tr>
<tr><td><b> Backspace </b></td><td> deletes the line above the current and moves everything below up one line.<br> </td></tr>
<tr><td><b> Insert </b></td><td> moves everything below down one step and clears the current line. </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<h3>Fields are:</h3>
<pre>00|b-6 2  0
01|--- 0  0
02|c-7 2  0
03|b-6 0 97
   |   | +- effect and argument (see below)
   |   +--- instrumentnumber (hex)
   +------- note and octave</pre>
<h3>Effects</h3>
Maybe more effects will be added in the future,
please only use documented effects (others will do nothing, but that will change in future versions).
<p>
Unlike older trackers sawteeth effects continues when you have started them.
If you write a0 to lower the volume the volume decreases until the next note or other command that affects the volume (bx,cx)
<p>

<table>
<tr><td align=right><b>0</b></td><td>	no effect				</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right><b>1 x</b></td><td> glide pitch up			</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right><b>2 x</b></td><td> glide pitch down		</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right><b>3 x</b></td><td> glide pitch to note	(will glide to 0Hz if no note)	</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right><b>4 x</b></td><td> set PWM offset			</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right><b>5 x</b></td><td> set resonance (is not multiplicated with the reso setting in the instrument)			</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right><b>7 x</b></td><td> glide filter closed		</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right><b>8 x</b></td><td> glide filter open		</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right><b>9 x</b></td><td> set filter				</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right><b>a x</b></td><td> glide amp down			</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right><b>b x</b></td><td> glide amp up			</td></tr>
<tr><td align=right><b>c x</b></td><td> set amp					</td></tr>
</table>


<h2>Instrument editor</h2>
A block scheme over the sound creation looks something like this: (boost is only used with clipping)
<p>
wave -&gt; amplitude -&gt; filter -&gt; boost -&gt; clipping
<p>
<h3>Envelope - editors</h3>
There are two editors for curves (envelopes, like ADSR), one controlling
amplitude and one the filters' cutoff-frequency.
<p>
The filtermodes low-pass(no res) and low-pass are of different type than the others,
they use slightly less CPU. To save CPU,
use no filter when you don't need to.
<p>
Currently there are two clipmodes, hard clip and sinus clip. Try the sinus clip for some WHACKO distortion. Please give me suggestions of more clipmodes.
<p>
At the bottom of the window there are sliders that control the lfo's for PWM (only Square) and Vibrato.
<p>

<h3>Tracker fields are:</h3>
<pre>00|c-1 @ 2
01|--- @ 0
   |   | +-- waveform (see below)
   |   +---- relative (bit, change state width space)
   +-------- note and octave</pre>

Below the tracker are three textgadgets: lenght, speed and loop.
The number in the Speed-textgadget is PAL's (1/50th of a second) per step.
The number in the Loop-textgadget is the tracker-position to go when playing reached end.
To not loop, enter the last position in the tracker. 
<h3>Waveforms</h3>
<table>
<tr><td><b>0</b></td><td> Hold </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>1</b></td><td> Saw </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>2</b></td><td> Square </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>3</b></td><td> Triangle </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>4</b></td><td> Noise </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>5</b></td><td> Sine </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>6</b></td><td> Triangle without interpolation (no big cpu gain)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>7</b></td><td> Sine without interpolation</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Breakpoints</h2>
This is only used by me so far, for inserting sync-information in songs.
In the part-editor press the following keys. The breakpoints will be visible in the
top of the sequencer vindow.
<table>
<tr><td><b>cmd-0 to cmd-9</b></td><td>insert breakpoint</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>cmd-r</b></td><td>remove breakpoint</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Tips n' tricks</h2>
Please tell me some tips that I can add.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
	To make a song really small (in bytes):
	<ul>
	<li>
		Be sure to use File-&gt;ExportRelease to save your completed song. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Try to reuse parts as often as you
		can, and try to make parts reusable.
		A bassline can be reused most of the time
		since you can transpose it.
	</li>
	<li>
		Try to reuse instruments as often as you
		can, and try to make them reusable. A great
		bass sound can be an even cooler leadsound,
		use part effects to make the the same
		instrument sound different.
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
	To reduce audible clicks:
	<ul>
	<li>
		When making arpeggio-tricks in an instrument, be careful
		when using different waveforms in the same instrument, some
		combinations can produce clicks.
	</li>
	</ul>
<li>
	To mute a channel, check the box to the left in the control window.
</li>
<li>
	To hear only the part you're editing press cmd-space when a part-edit
	window is focused.
</li>
<li>
	Noise has got a frequency also. Use noise to create cool percussive effects.
</li>
<li>
	You can change the volume on a part in the sequencer. (ctrl-leftarrow and ctrl-rightarrow)
</li>
<li>
	When you are editing the amp and filter-cutoff-envelope,
	remember that you can only <b>lower</b> the volume / cutoff
	with part-effects.
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Using your song elsewhere</h1>
<p>Sawteeth comes with a library called libST to replay your music in another application. The lib has a C++ API which is used as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Load your song data in a txt object. This can be done either from a file or a buffer in memory</li>
	<li>Create a Song from your txt object.</li>
	<li>Call the Play() method of the Song to fill your audio buffer</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Just want other people to listen to your song ? They can also use APlayer to play it.</p>
